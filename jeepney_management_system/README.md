# JeepneyManagementSystem
An experimental python-based jeepney fare management system that simulates fare collection, applies discounts, computes change, and records transactions.

This project is a digital fare management system for jeepneys, written in Python.
It simulates how jeepney drivers handle fare collection, apply discounts, compute change, and record transactions. The long-term goal is to expand this into a more complete system with features like data analytics, database support, and possibly GPS integration.

Features (Current)
-Passenger fare collection (regular, student, senior)
-Change computation and transaction logging
-Simple text-based interface
-Transaction history display
----------------------------------------------------
Planned Features

Phase 1 – Core Improvements
    Better input validation and error handling
    Passenger counting and capacity tracking
    Daily and weekly revenue reporting
----------------------------------------------------
Phase 2 – Data and Analytics
    Passenger pattern analysis (peak hours, frequent stops)
    Route-based revenue forecasting
    Profitability insights
----------------------------------------------------
Phase 3 – Advanced Features
    Database integration (SQLite → PostgreSQL)
    GPS route tracking
    Web dashboard for operators
    Mobile app companion for drivers
----------------------------------------------------
Phase 4 – Research-Level Integration
    Machine learning for demand prediction
    Route optimization algorithms
    IoT-based seat occupancy detection
----------------------------------------------------
Possible Thesis Alignment

Title:
    “Development of an Intelligent Fare Management System for Philippine Jeepneys: A Data-Driven Approach to Public Transportation Optimization”

Problem Statement:
    Fare collection in jeepneys is still mostly manual, leading to inefficiencies, lack of financial transparency, and challenges in monitoring operations. A digital system could help improve revenue management and provide insights for better transportation planning.
